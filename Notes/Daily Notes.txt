Bugs:

//Hit Marker doesnt register often
Changing skills doesnt result in correct amount of hit markers.
//Selecting a skill too early makes attack bar dark, breaking everything
//Damage is always a static number, instead of being different.

Wanted Features:
Skill CD functionality / visual
Energy remaining UI
Combat turn order
enemy attacks

After the use of a skill (Warrior basic/primary) attacking again gives an exception error.
The user must not be able to use the skill again. (do cooldowns) (ok doing it).

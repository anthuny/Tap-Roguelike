Bugs:

//Hit Marker doesnt register often
////Changing skills doesnt result in correct amount of hit markers.
//Selecting a skill too early makes attack bar dark, breaking everything
//Damage is always a static number, instead of being different.

Wanted Features:

//Skill CD functionality / visual
//Energy remaining UI
enemy attacks
Create Honor Submiss passive 
Combat turn order

//After the use of a skill (Warrior basic/primary) attacking again gives an exception error.
//Unit's don't recieve damage from being marked

Changes:
Attack Bar now moves to a higher position when a skill is active.
User no longer has a default starting skill.
Players can optionally press the cancel button to exit the skill, if the player hasn't began attacking with it yet.

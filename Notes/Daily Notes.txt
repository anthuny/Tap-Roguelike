Bugs:

//Hit Marker doesnt register often
////Changing skills doesnt result in correct amount of hit markers.
//Selecting a skill too early makes attack bar dark, breaking everything
//Damage is always a static number, instead of being different.

Wanted Features:
Make dmg inflciting effects deal seperate lines of attacks, proceeding during or after the inflicting attack.
Skill CD functionality / visual
Energy remaining UI
Combat turn order
enemy attacks

//After the use of a skill (Warrior basic/primary) attacking again gives an exception error.

Changes:

User no longer has a default starting skill.
Players can optionally press the cancel button to exit the skill, if the player hasn't began attacking with it yet.


Attack Bar Hider no longer works.
